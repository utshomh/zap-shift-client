    content: `
      We started with a simple idea — making parcel delivery effortless for everyone. 
      What began as a small neighborhood service slowly grew into something much bigger. 
      From humble beginnings with a single delivery van and a handful of customers, 
      we built our foundation on reliability, transparency, and trust.
      ---
      Over the years, we embraced evolving technology, expanded our service areas, 
      and invested in better tracking, logistics, and customer support. 
      Every step of our journey has been shaped by the needs of our users — 
      individuals who rely on us to deliver gifts, essentials, documents, 
      and irreplaceable items on time and with care.
      ---
      Today, our mission remains unchanged: to simplify delivery and make 
      logistics feel human, predictable, and stress-free.

    title: "Our Mission",

      Our mission is to redefine what “fast” and “reliable” truly mean in the modern delivery world. 
      Speed alone isn’t enough — customers need accuracy, transparency, and complete control over their parcels.
      ---
      We focus on creating a seamless journey from pickup to drop-off. 
      This includes real-time tracking, proactive communication, 
      and systems designed to prevent delays before they even happen. 
      ---
      At the heart of our mission is a belief that every delivery matters — 
      whether it’s a personal package filled with emotion or an urgent business shipment. 
      We work tirelessly to ensure every customer feels confident and cared for.

    title: "Our Success",

      Success for us isn't measured only in numbers — though thousands of on-time 
      deliveries do make us smile. Our real success lies in the satisfaction, 
      trust, and loyalty of our community.
      ---
      Over time, we’ve expanded our fleet, built strong partnerships, 
      trained dedicated personnel, and optimized our entire logistics chain. 
      These efforts have allowed us to consistently maintain high delivery accuracy 
      and fast processing speeds.
      ---
      Yet, the most meaningful victories come from the stories our customers share — 
      the relief of a package arriving early, the joy of a birthday gift reaching 
      the right hands, and the confidence businesses place in our service. 
      Those stories fuel everything we do.

    title: "Terms & Others",
    content: `
      We believe transparency is essential in building trust, especially when it comes to parcel delivery. 
      Our terms are designed to be clear, fair, and user-focused — avoiding confusing language 
      and unnecessary complexity.
      ---
      Within our policies, you can find how we handle package protection, data privacy, 
      delivery exceptions, and compensation in rare cases of delays or issues. 
      We continuously update our terms to reflect improvements in our service and feedback from customers.
      ---
      Beyond policies, we maintain a strong commitment to ethical operations, 
      environmental responsibility, and continuous innovation. 
      Everything we do is guided by the goal of providing a smooth, dependable, and honest service.
